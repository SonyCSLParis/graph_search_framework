The Flanders Campaign was a series of military operations that took place during the early stages of the French Revolutionary Wars, specifically between 1792 and 1795, in the Austrian Netherlands, which corresponds to present-day Belgium and Luxembourg. The campaign involved forces of Revolutionary France fighting against a coalition that included Austria, Prussia, Britain, and other states opposed to the French Revolution.

The campaign began with initial French invasions in 1792, which were largely unsuccessful due to poor organization and leadership. However, the tide turned in 1793 after the French adopted a strategy of mass conscription, known as the lev√©e en masse, which significantly bolstered their forces. Key battles during this period included the Battle of Neerwinden in March 1793, where the French suffered a significant defeat, leading to a temporary withdrawal from the Austrian Netherlands.

Despite early setbacks, the French regrouped and launched a series of counteroffensives in 1794. The most notable success came with the Battle of Fleurus in June 1794, where the French secured a decisive victory, demonstrating the effectiveness of their mass conscription army and innovative use of reconnaissance balloons. This victory allowed the French to capture Brussels and eventually control the entire Austrian Netherlands by the end of 1794.

The Flanders Campaign marked a turning point in the Revolutionary Wars, showcasing the strength of the revolutionary French army and leading to the expansion of French control across much of Europe. It also set the stage for the subsequent campaigns and the rise of Napoleon Bonaparte.
