The Infernal Columns, led by French Revolutionary General Louis Marie Turreau during the War in the Vendée, were a series of military operations aimed at suppressing Royalist uprisings following the failure of the Royalist Virée de Galerne. These operations were initiated after the National Convention passed laws on 1 August 1793 and 1 October 1793, with the stated goal of exterminating "brigands" south of the Loire River, an area known as the Vendée. To achieve this, 12 army columns were dispatched to the region with orders to exterminate the local anti-Republican population. In January 1794, Turreau outlined his tactics in a letter to the National Convention's Minister for War, expressing his intention to "burn everything" to ensure the rebels' extermination. It is estimated that between 16,000 to 40,000 inhabitants were killed during the first quarter of 1794.

The actions and consequences of the Infernal Columns have sparked significant debate among historians and the public, both within France and internationally. French historian Reynald Secher has described their operations as a form of Franco-French genocide, a claim that has been criticized by Claude Langlois of the Institute of History of the French Revolution as being quasi-mythological. This debate remains highly politicized. The term "Infernal Column" has also been applied to similar movements, such as in the Voulet-Chanoine Mission, indicating the lasting impact and controversial nature of these operations.
