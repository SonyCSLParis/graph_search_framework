The Action of 19 December 1796, during the French Revolutionary Wars, culminated in a significant naval engagement near the coast of Portugal, specifically off the Lisbon harbor. This confrontation was part of the wider struggle between Britain and France for maritime supremacy and control over strategic trade routes.

Leading up to this event, the French had been attempting to disrupt British trade and weaken its naval power by targeting merchant ships and engaging in naval battles. The British Royal Navy, aiming to protect its trade routes and maintain its dominance at sea, was on high alert for French naval activities.

On the day of the action, a British squadron under the command of Sir Edward Pellew, aboard the HMS Indefatigable, encountered and engaged a French squadron. The French were attempting to return to Brest from a commerce raiding mission in the Atlantic and around the coast of Portugal. The engagement was marked by a chase and a battle that resulted in the capture of the French frigate Droits de l'Homme by the British. The Droits de l'Homme was driven ashore in a storm during the engagement and wrecked, leading to a significant loss of life among the French crew.

The outcome of the Action of 19 December 1796 was a British victory, which not only demonstrated the Royal Navy's superior seamanship and tactical abilities but also significantly impacted French morale and their ability to project naval power. This event was part of the ongoing naval warfare between Britain and France, which saw numerous engagements throughout the period of the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars.
