During the French Revolution, Jacques Gilles Henri Goguet played a significant role in several military engagements as part of the French Revolutionary Wars. Notably, he was involved in the Battle of Peyrestortes on 17 September 1793, where forces from the French Army of the Eastern Pyrenees, temporarily commanded by Eustache Charles d'Aoust and Jacques Gilles Henri Goguet, defeated two divisions of the Army of Catalonia led by Juan de Courten and Jerónimo Girón-Moctezuma, Marquis de las Amarillas. This victory marked a high point in the French defense against the Spanish invasion of Roussillon, with the French managing to rout the Spanish divisions from their fortified camps.

Later, Jacques Gilles Henri Goguet also participated in the Battle of Le Cateau on 29 March 1794, during the start of the 1794 Flanders Campaign, which was part of the War of the First Coalition. In this battle, three Republican French divisions led by Antoine Balland, Jacques Gilles Henri Goguet, and Jacques Fromentin attacked a Habsburg Austrian force commanded by Paul Kray. However, the outcome was less favorable for the French, as the Austrians drove off the French forces and inflicted significant casualties, marking a Coalition victory.

These engagements highlight Jacques Gilles Henri Goguet's active involvement in the military efforts of the French Republic during the tumultuous years of the French Revolution and the broader context of the War of the First Coalition.
