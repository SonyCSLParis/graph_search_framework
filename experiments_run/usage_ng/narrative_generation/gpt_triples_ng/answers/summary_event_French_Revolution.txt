The French Revolution, a period of radical political and societal change in France, began in 1789 with the Estates General's convocation and concluded with the French Consulate's formation in November 1799. It introduced many liberal democracy principles, influencing global movements for slavery abolition and universal suffrage. The Revolution's causes were multifaceted, including social, political, and economic factors that the existing regime could not manage. Key events included the abolition of feudalism, state control of the Catholic Church, and the extension of voting rights. The Revolution faced both internal and external opposition, leading to the French Revolutionary Wars.

The execution of Louis XVI in January 1793 marked a turning point, leading to the establishment of the First French Republic and the Reign of Terror, overseen by the Committee of Public Safety and Maximilien Robespierre, which aimed to purge counter-revolutionaries. Over 16,600 people were executed during this period. The Republic also faced internal revolts, such as the War in the Vend√©e, a Royalist uprising with deep religious and democratic conflict themes, and the Revolt of Lyon against the National Convention, showcasing moderates' opposition to radical policies.

Significant military and civil conflicts during this period included the War of the Second Coalition, an attempt by European monarchies to quell the revolutionary government, which ultimately failed to overthrow the regime. The internal conflict was marked by events like the Women's March on Versailles, driven by revolutionary agitators, and the Flight to Varennes, which exposed the monarchy's opposition to revolutionary reforms. The Revolution also saw the Proclamation of the Abolition of the Monarchy, marking France's transition from a monarchy to a republic.

The French Directory, which took power in November 1795, struggled with economic stagnation and internal divisions, leading to its replacement by the Consulate in November 1799, a move that historians generally view as the Revolution's end. The Revolution profoundly impacted French politics and society, laying the groundwork for modern liberal democracy and influencing subsequent global revolutions.
