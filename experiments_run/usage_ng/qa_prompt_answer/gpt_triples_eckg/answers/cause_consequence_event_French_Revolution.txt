The French Revolution, a period of radical political and societal change in France, began in May 1789 with the convocation of the Estates-General due to widespread social distress. This assembly was converted into the National Assembly in June, marking the start of significant reforms including the abolition of feudalism, state control of the Catholic Church, and the extension of voting rights. The Revolution's causes were a mix of social, political, and economic factors that the existing regime could not manage.

Disillusionment with King Louis XVI led to the establishment of the First French Republic on 22 September 1792, followed by his execution in January 1793. The Revolution faced both internal and external threats, with countries like Austria, Britain, and Prussia viewing it as a threat, leading to the French Revolutionary Wars in April 1792. Internally, the Reign of Terror, led by Maximilien Robespierre and the Committee of Public Safety, sought to eradicate counter-revolutionaries, resulting in over 16,600 executions.

Following the Reign of Terror, the French Directory took power in November 1795 but struggled with economic stagnation, military challenges, and internal divisions. Ultimately, in November 1799, the Directory was replaced by the French Consulate, marking the end of the Revolutionary period. This transition was influenced by the need to address the ongoing military success that paradoxically led to economic challenges and the inability of the Directory to manage the country's internal divisions effectively.
