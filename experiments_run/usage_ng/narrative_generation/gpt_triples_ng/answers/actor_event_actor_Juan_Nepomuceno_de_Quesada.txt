During the French Revolution, Juan Nepomuceno de Quesada was involved in the Capture of Menorca in November 1798. This event saw a British expedition successfully capture the island of Menorca from Spain. Under the command of General Charles Stuart, a large British force landed on Menorca and compelled its Spanish garrison, with which Quesada was associated, to surrender in just eight days, experiencing only some bloodshed. The British then occupied Menorca for four years, utilizing it as a significant naval base, until it was returned to Spain following the Treaty of Amiens. This episode took place against the backdrop of the Enlightenment in Spain, marking a significant moment in the broader context of European conflicts during the era.
