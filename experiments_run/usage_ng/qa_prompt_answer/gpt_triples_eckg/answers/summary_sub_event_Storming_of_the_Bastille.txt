The Storming of the Bastille on 14 July 1789 was a pivotal event in Paris, France, marking the flashpoint of the French Revolution. The Bastille, a medieval armory, fortress, and political prison, symbolized royal authority and the monarchy's abuse of power in the heart of Paris. Despite holding only seven inmates at the time, its capture by revolutionaries was a significant act against King Louis XVI's regime. Key figures involved included Bernard-René Jourdan de Launay, the governor of the Bastille, and revolutionaries like Pierre-Augustin Hulin and Stanislas-Marie Maillard.

This event is directly linked to the Fête de la Fédération, celebrated on 14 July 1790, and later becoming the precursor to Bastille Day, a national holiday in France commemorating the Revolution and National Unity. The Fête de la Fédération was a massive festival honoring the French Revolution, emphasizing the unity and achievements of the revolutionary movement.

The Storming of the Bastille also relates to other significant revolutionary events, such as the Women's March on Versailles, highlighting the interconnectedness of the revolutionary activities that reshaped France. These events collectively underscored the widespread discontent with the monarchy and the desire for a new social and political order, leading to profound changes in French society and governance.
