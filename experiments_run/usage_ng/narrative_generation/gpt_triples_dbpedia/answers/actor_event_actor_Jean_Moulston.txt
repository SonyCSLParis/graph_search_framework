During the French Revolution, specifically in the Atlantic raid of June 1796, Jean Moulston served as a commander in a French squadron involved in the campaign. This campaign was part of the French Revolutionary Wars and consisted of three minor naval engagements in the Western Approaches, aimed at disrupting British commerce. The French squadron, which included three frigates and one corvette, was operating against British trade when it encountered a British squadron patrolling the area. Despite the French orders to avoid engagement with British warships and focus on commerce raiding, they were pursued by the British frigates HMS Unicorn and HMS Santa Margarita.

The French squadron attempted to retreat, but the British forces managed to catch up. The HMS Santa Margarita engaged and defeated the French frigate Tamise, while the HMS Unicorn later caught and defeated the Tribune after a hard-fought engagement. The corvette Légėre managed to withdraw without engaging in the conflict. However, the French frigate Proserpine, which had been separated from the squadron, was later captured by the British frigate HMS Dryad, and Légėre was also captured by another British patrol without a fight.

The campaign resulted in a British victory, with all four captured French ships being purchased for service in the Royal Navy. French casualties were very heavy across all three engagements, while British losses were light. Jean Moulston's role as a commander in this campaign placed him directly in the midst of these naval conflicts during the French Revolutionary Wars.
