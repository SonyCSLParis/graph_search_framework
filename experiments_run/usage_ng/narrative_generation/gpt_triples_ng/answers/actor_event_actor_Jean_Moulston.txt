During the French Revolution, specifically in the Atlantic raid of June 1796, Jean Moulston was involved as an actor in a short campaign that included three minor naval engagements in the Western Approaches of the Atlantic Ocean. This campaign was part of the Royal Navy's efforts to counter French frigates that were negatively impacting British commerce during the French Revolutionary Wars. The engagements occurred on June 22, 1796, and involved British frigates attempting to eliminate a squadron of French ships operating against British trade. The French squadron, under orders to avoid engagement with British warships, attempted to retreat but was pursued by the British. The engagements resulted in heavy casualties for the French and the capture of all four French ships involved, which were later incorporated into the Royal Navy. Jean Moulston's specific role or fate in these events is not detailed in the provided context, but his involvement indicates he was part of these naval operations during the French Revolutionary Wars.
