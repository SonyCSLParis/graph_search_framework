The Storming of the Bastille, a pivotal event during the French Revolution, took place on the afternoon of 14 July 1789 in Paris, France. The Bastille, a medieval armory, fortress, and political prison, symbolized royal authority and the monarchy's abuse of power in the heart of Paris. Despite holding only seven inmates at the time, its capture by revolutionaries marked the flashpoint of the French Revolution. The assault involved civilian insurgents, including mutineers from the French Guards, against the royal government's forces, which comprised 114 soldiers (82 veterans and 32 Swiss soldiers) and 30 artillery pieces. The insurgents, numbering between 688 to 1,000 armed civilians supported by 61 French Guards and at least five artillery pieces, achieved a decisive victory, capturing the Bastille. The confrontation resulted in 98 killed and 73 wounded. Key figures in the storming included Bernard-René Jourdan de Launay, the commander of the Bastille, and insurgent leaders Pierre-Augustin Hulin and Stanislas-Marie Maillard. The event is celebrated annually in France on 14 July, known as Bastille Day. It was part of the broader French Revolution and took place in the Kingdom of France, specifically in Paris, Île-de-France. Notable participants also included Jean Antoine Rossignol and James Bartholomew Blackwell.
