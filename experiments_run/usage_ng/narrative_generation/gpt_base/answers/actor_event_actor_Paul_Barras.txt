During the French Revolution, Paul Barras was a prominent political figure who played a key role in the downfall of Maximilien Robespierre on 9 Thermidor (July 27, 1794), contributing to the end of the Reign of Terror. After Robespierre's fall, Barras became a leading member of the French Directory, a five-member committee that governed France from 1795 until 1799. His tenure in the Directory was marked by corruption and political maneuvering. Barras's political career effectively ended with the coup of 18 Brumaire (November 9, 1799), led by Napoleon Bonaparte, which overthrew the Directory and established the Consulate, leading to Napoleon's eventual rise to power as Emperor of the French.
