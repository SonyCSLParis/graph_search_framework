During the French Revolution, specifically in the context of the Irish Rebellion of 1798, William Lumley played a role in the Battle of Antrim, which occurred on June 7, 1798. This battle was part of the wider conflict in Ireland during that period, where Irish insurgents, led by Henry Joy McCracken, sought to challenge British rule. The battle took place in Antrim, County Antrim, Ireland. Despite the efforts of the Irish insurgents, the British troops, with whom William Lumley was associated, emerged victorious. The British managed to fend off the rebel attack on Antrim town, especially after receiving reinforcements. However, it's important to note that the county governor, John O'Neill, 1st Viscount O'Neill, was fatally wounded in the battle. William Lumley's involvement indicates his participation on the British side during this key event of the Irish Rebellion of 1798.
