The Action of 19 December 1796, a minor naval engagement during the French Revolutionary Wars, concluded with an inconclusive result. The battle involved two British Royal Navy frigates, HMS Minerve and HMS Blanche, commanded by Commodore Horatio Nelson, and two Spanish Navy frigates, Sabina and Ceres, under Commodore Don Jacobo Stuart. The engagement took place off the coast of Murcia, in the Mediterranean Sea.

The causal events leading to this engagement began with the shifting alliances and declarations of war that characterized the period. Spain, having been an ally of Britain, was compelled to sign a peace treaty with the French Republic in August 1795. Subsequently, under the terms of the Treaty of San Ildefonso signed on 5 October 1796, Spain declared war on Britain. This declaration came just two months before the action and significantly altered the strategic landscape in the Mediterranean.

The British Mediterranean Fleet, under Vice-Admiral Sir John Jervis, found itself outnumbered and isolated, prompting a withdrawal to Lisbon and the establishment of a blockade of the Spanish naval base at CÃ¡diz. By December 1796, the only remaining British forces in the Mediterranean were the garrison on the island of Elba. Jervis decided to evacuate the island and dispatched Nelson with the frigates HMS Minerve and HMS Blanche to carry out the operation.

During their mission, Nelson's squadron encountered the Spanish frigates off Murcia. Nelson engaged the Spanish ships, capturing Sabina and damaging Ceres. However, the appearance of a larger Spanish squadron, including two more frigates and the 112-gun ship of the line Principe de Asturias, forced Nelson to abandon the captured Sabina and retreat. The Spanish recaptured Sabina, and Nelson successfully evacuated the Elba garrison without further engagements.

The engagement resulted in 42 captured, 44 wounded, and 7 killed on the British side. Despite the initial capture of Sabina, the battle was deemed inconclusive due to the British withdrawal and the recapture of the Spanish frigate. This action was part of the broader context of the French Revolutionary Wars and showcased the dynamic and often precarious nature of naval warfare during the period.
