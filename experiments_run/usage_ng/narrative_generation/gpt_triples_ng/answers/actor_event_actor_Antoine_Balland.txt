During the French Revolution, Antoine Balland played significant roles in two notable events. Firstly, he was a leader in the Battle of Le Cateau, which occurred on March 29, 1794. This battle was part of the 1794 Flanders Campaign during the War of the First Coalition, a segment of the French Revolutionary Wars. In this battle, Balland, alongside Jacques Gilles Henri Goguet and Jacques Fromentin, led three Republican French divisions against a Habsburg Austrian force commanded by Paul Kray. Unfortunately for Balland and his forces, the Austrians were victorious, driving off the French and inflicting significantly higher casualties on the French side.

Later, Antoine Balland was involved in the Veronese Easter, a rebellion that took place during the Italian campaign of 1797. This event unfolded in Verona and the surrounding areas of the Veneto region, then part of the Republic of Venice, against the French occupying forces under Balland's command. The rebellion was sparked by the oppressive behavior of the French, including asset confiscation and attempts to overthrow the local government. It began on the morning of April 17, 1797, and saw the local population successfully defeating and capturing more than a thousand French soldiers. The revolt concluded on April 25, 1797, with the encirclement and capture of the town by 15,000 soldiers, leading to the imposition of a hefty fine on the town and the surrender of various assets, including artwork.
