Guillaume Brune and Magnus Gustav von Essen were both involved in the French Revolutionary Wars, specifically during the campaigns in the Netherlands and Italy. However, their paths did not directly intersect in a specific battle or event solely within the context of the French Revolution, as their careers spanned different geographies and periods within these wars. Brune was more directly involved in the internal events of the French Revolution and its immediate military campaigns, while von Essen's notable service was primarily during the Napoleonic Wars, a continuation and expansion of the conflicts that followed the French Revolution.
