At the end of the Battle of Winterthur on 27 May 1799, the Austrians, commanded by Friedrich Freiherr von Hotze, successfully pushed the French forces out of the Winterthur highlands after sustaining an 11-hour assault. This victory was crucial as it allowed the consolidation of three Austrian forces on the plateau north of Zürich. This strategic positioning led to the French defeat a few days later when Archduke Charles, with the now united Habsburg armies, attacked French positions at Zürich, forcing the French to retreat beyond the Limmat river.

The causal happenings leading to the Battle of Winterthur began with the Austrians gaining control over parts of Switzerland from the French, as forces under Hotze and Count Heinrich von Bellegarde expelled the French from the Grisons. Following their victories at the battles of Ostrach and Stockach, the main Austrian army, led by Archduke Charles, crossed the Rhine at Schaffhausen, aiming to unite with the armies of Hotze and Friedrich Joseph, Count of Nauendorf, near Zürich. To prevent this merger, the French Army of Helvetia and the Army of the Danube, under André Masséna's command, engaged the Austrians. Masséna dispatched Michel Ney with a small force to confront Hotze's troops at Winterthur. Despite a fierce battle and high casualties on both sides, the Austrians succeeded in their objective, setting the stage for the subsequent French defeat at Zürich.
