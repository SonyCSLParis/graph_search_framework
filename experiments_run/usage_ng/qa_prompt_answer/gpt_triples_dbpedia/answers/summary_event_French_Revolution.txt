The French Revolution, a period of radical political and societal change in France, spanned from 1789 to 1799. It began with the convocation of the Estates General and concluded with the establishment of the French Consulate. This era is celebrated for introducing many ideas that became the bedrock of liberal democracy, including the enduring motto "Liberté, égalité, fraternité." The Revolution's influence extended beyond France, inspiring movements for the abolition of slavery and universal suffrage, and resonating in events like the 1917 Russian Revolution.

The Revolution's causes were multifaceted, encompassing social, political, and economic distress that the existing regime could not manage. In response to widespread social distress, the Estates-General was convened in May 1789, transforming into the National Assembly by June. This body enacted radical reforms such as the abolition of feudalism, state control over the Catholic Church, and the expansion of voting rights.

The subsequent years saw intense political struggle, economic depression, and social unrest. The situation escalated into the French Revolutionary Wars as external powers like Austria, Britain, and Prussia perceived the Revolution as a threat. Discontent with King Louis XVI led to the proclamation of the First French Republic in 1792 and his execution in 1793. The rise of the Committee of Public Safety, led by Maximilien Robespierre, marked the Reign of Terror, during which over 16,600 people were executed as counter-revolutionaries.

The Revolution faced both external and internal challenges, including Royalist and Jacobin revolts. The French Directory assumed power in 1795 but was plagued by military success overshadowed by economic stagnation and internal divisions. In 1799, the Directory was replaced by the Consulate, marking the end of the Revolutionary period.

Notable figures involved in the Revolution include Francisco de Miranda, Georges Washington de La Fayette, Gilbert du Motier (Marquis de Lafayette), and others who participated in military engagements. Influential thinkers like Jean-Jacques Rousseau also played a role in shaping the Revolution's ideals. The Revolution encompassed key battles and events such as the Storming of the Bastille and the Fall of Maximilien Robespierre, which were pivotal in the conflict's progression.
