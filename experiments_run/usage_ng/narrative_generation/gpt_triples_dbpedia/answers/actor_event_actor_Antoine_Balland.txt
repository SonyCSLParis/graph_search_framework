During the French Revolution, Antoine Balland was a military figure involved in several significant actions. He led three Republican French divisions in the Battle of Le Cateau on 29 March 1794, which took place at the start of the 1794 Flanders Campaign during the War of the First Coalition. This battle saw his forces attacking a Habsburg Austrian force commanded by Paul Kray. Unfortunately for Balland and his troops, the Austrians drove off the French and inflicted heavy casualties, with the French suffering four casualties for every Austrian casualty. The battle resulted in a Coalition victory.

Additionally, Antoine Balland was involved in the Veronese Easter, a rebellion during the Italian campaign of 1797. This event saw the inhabitants of Verona and the surrounding areas revolting against the French occupying forces under Balland's command, while Napoleon Bonaparte was engaged in Austria. The rebellion began on the morning of 17 April 1797 and ended on 25 April 1797 with the French forces encircling and capturing the town of Verona. The French victory forced the town to pay a significant fine and hand over various assets, including artwork. This event was part of the campaigns of 1797 in the French Revolutionary Wars and contributed to the fall of the Republic of Venice.
