Guillaume Brune and Magnus Gustav von Essen were both involved in the Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland during the War of the Second Coalition. Specifically, they played roles in the following events:

1. **Battle of Alkmaar (1799)**: This battle took place on 2 October 1799 near Alkmaar, involving forces of the French Republic and the Batavian Republic under the command of General Guillaume Brune, against an expeditionary force from Great Britain and Russia, which included Magnus Gustav von Essen. The battle ended in a tactical draw but prompted Brune to order a strategic withdrawal.

2. **Battle of Castricum**: Fought on 6 October 1799, this battle saw a Franco-Dutch force under General Guillaume Brune and Herman Willem Daendels defeat an Anglo-Russian force near Castricum, Netherlands. Magnus Gustav von Essen was also a commander in this battle, which was part of the Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland. The victory at Castricum led to a Franco-Batavian victory in the campaign.
