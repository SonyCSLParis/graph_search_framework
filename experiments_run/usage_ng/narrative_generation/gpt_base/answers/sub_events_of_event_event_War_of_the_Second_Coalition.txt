The War of the Second Coalition (1798–1802) was a major conflict during the French Revolutionary Wars, involving France against a coalition of European powers. Here are the main events in chronological order:

1. **Formation of the Second Coalition (1798)**: Reacting to French expansion, Britain, Austria, Russia, the Ottoman Empire, Portugal, Naples, and other states formed the Second Coalition against France.

2. **French Invasion of Egypt (1798)**: Aimed at undermining British access to India, Napoleon Bonaparte invaded Egypt in July 1798 but was stranded after the British naval victory at the Battle of the Nile in August 1798.

3. **Italian Campaigns (1799)**: Coalition forces, particularly the Austrians and Russians under the command of Suvorov, recaptured much of Italy from the French, reversing many of Napoleon's achievements.

4. **Swiss Campaign (1799)**: French forces, under Masséna, fought against the Austrians and Russians in Switzerland, culminating in the French victory at the Second Battle of Zurich in September 1799.

5. **Russian Withdrawal (1799)**: Disillusioned with the coalition and facing problems at home, Tsar Paul I of Russia withdrew his troops from the conflict in late 1799.

6. **Napoleon's Rise to Power (1799)**: Exploiting the instability in France, Napoleon returned from Egypt, staged a coup (18 Brumaire), and became First Consul of France in November 1799.

7. **Marengo and Hohenlinden (1800)**: Napoleon personally led a campaign in Italy, culminating in the decisive French victory at Marengo in June. Another significant victory at Hohenlinden in December, led by Moreau, forced Austria to sue for peace.

8. **Peace of Lunéville (1801)**: Austria signed the Peace of Lunéville in February 1801, ceding control of Italy and the Rhineland to France and effectively ending the war on the continent.

9. **Treaty of Amiens (1802)**: Britain, the last remaining coalition member at war with France, signed the Treaty of Amiens in March 1802, temporarily halting hostilities between Britain and France and bringing the War of the Second Coalition to an end.

These events marked significant shifts in European power dynamics and set the stage for the Napoleonic Wars.
