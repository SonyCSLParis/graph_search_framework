During the French Revolution, specifically in November 1798, Juan Nepomuceno de Quesada was involved in the Capture of Minorca, which was part of the War of the Second Coalition. This event saw a British expedition, led by General Charles Stuart and Sir John Duckworth, successfully capturing the island of Menorca (historically called "Minorca" by the British) from Spain, where Juan Nepomuceno de Quesada was one of the Spanish commanders. The British forces, comprising 20 warships, 8 frigates, and a total of 10,000 troops, landed on the island and forced its Spanish garrison to surrender in eight days with only some bloodshed. The British victory was achieved with light casualties and they occupied the island for four years, using it as a major naval base, before it was returned to Spain following the Treaty of Amiens.
