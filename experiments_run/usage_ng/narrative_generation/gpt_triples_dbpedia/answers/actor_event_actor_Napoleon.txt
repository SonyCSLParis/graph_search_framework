During the French Revolution, Napoleon Bonaparte emerged as a prominent military leader who played a crucial role in defending the revolutionary government and expanding French territories. His rise to prominence began with his decisive action during the 13 Vendémiaire, where he quelled a Royalist uprising in Paris using artillery, earning him recognition and rapid advancement in military ranks.

Napoleon's military campaigns during the French Revolutionary Wars further established his reputation as a brilliant strategist. He led the French Army of Italy to several victories against the Austrians and their allies, significantly at the battles of Montenotte, Lodi, Castiglione, and Arcole, showcasing his ability to outmaneuver enemy forces and secure crucial territories for France. These victories not only expanded French influence but also disrupted the plans of the Coalition forces aiming to contain the French Revolution.

His campaign in Egypt, part of the Mediterranean campaign of 1798, aimed to undermine British trade routes and establish French dominance in the Mediterranean. Despite initial successes, such as the capture of Malta and victories at the Battle of the Pyramids and the Siege of El Arish, the campaign ultimately faced setbacks. The British naval victory at the Battle of the Nile stranded Napoleon's forces in Egypt, and the Siege of Acre, bolstered by British naval support, ended in a French retreat.

Napoleon's actions during the French Revolution and the subsequent Revolutionary Wars laid the groundwork for his rise to power. His military genius, demonstrated through rapid and decisive victories, his ability to inspire his troops, and his strategic use of artillery, were key factors in his ascent. Despite facing setbacks, such as the failed invasion of Egypt, Napoleon's reputation as a military leader only grew, setting the stage for his eventual coup d'état and the establishment of the Consulate, marking the end of the French Revolution and the beginning of his rule as First Consul of France.
