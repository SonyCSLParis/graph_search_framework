Jean-Baptiste Jourdan and Joseph Bonaparte were both involved in the following events during the French Revolution:

1. **Rhine Campaign of 1795**: This campaign saw two Habsburg Austrian armies defeat two Republican French armies attempting to invade the south German states of the Holy Roman Empire.

3. **Battle of Pfeddersheim (1795)**: This battle saw a Habsburg Austrian army led by François Sébastien Charles Joseph de Croix, Count of Clerfayt, attack a Republican French army under Jean-Charles Pichegru. While the abstract does not directly mention Joseph Bonaparte's role, the context triples confirm his involvement alongside Jean-Baptiste Jourdan.

4. **Battle of Winterthur**: Both Jean-Baptiste Jourdan and Joseph Bonaparte were actors in this battle, which was an important action between elements of the Army of the Danube and elements of the Habsburg army during the War of the Second Coalition.
