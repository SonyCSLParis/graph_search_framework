During the French Revolution, Napoleon Bonaparte emerged as a prominent military leader who played a crucial role in several campaigns and battles that shaped the course of the revolution and his own future. Initially, he was involved in the Montenotte Campaign in 1796, where he successfully separated the Sardinian army from its Austrian allies, leading to significant French victories at battles such as Montenotte, Millesimo, and Mondovì. These victories forced Sardinia to exit the First Coalition against France.

Napoleon's innovative tactics and leadership were further demonstrated in battles across Italy, including the Battle of Lodi, which bolstered his reputation. His success in Italy continued with victories at Castiglione, Arcole, and Rivoli, each of which further weakened the Austrian position in the region.

In 1798, Napoleon led the French campaign in Egypt and Syria, aiming to undermine British trade routes and establish French influence in the Ottoman territories. Despite initial successes, including the notable Battle of the Pyramids where he employed the divisional square tactic effectively, the campaign ultimately faced setbacks. The Siege of Acre was a significant failure, and the defeat of the French fleet at the Battle of the Nile severely compromised French positions in the region.

The Revolt of Cairo against French occupation marked another challenge, showcasing local resistance to French rule. Despite these difficulties, Napoleon's actions in Egypt, such as the introduction of modern administrative practices and the scientific expedition that accompanied the military campaign, left a lasting impact.

Napoleon's return to France was timely, as political instability provided an opportunity for him to rise to power. The Coup of 18 Brumaire in 1799, a bloodless coup d'état, ended the Directory government and established the French Consulate with Napoleon as First Consul, effectively ending the French Revolution and beginning Napoleon's rule over France. This period marked the transition from the revolutionary turmoil to the Napoleonic era, where Napoleon would further consolidate his power and influence across Europe.
