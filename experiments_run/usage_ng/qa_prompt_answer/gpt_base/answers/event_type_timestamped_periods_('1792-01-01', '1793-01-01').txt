2. **Political Radicalization**: The revolution grew more radical, with increasing influence of the Jacobins and the sans-culottes, pushing for more extreme changes.

3. **Legislative Changes**: The Legislative Assembly saw intense debates and passed laws against emigres and refractory clergy, and also took steps towards establishing a republic.

4. **August 10, 1792 Insurrection**: A significant uprising led to the storming of the Tuileries Palace, the suspension of King Louis XVI, and the eventual downfall of the monarchy.

5. **Establishment of the National Convention**: In September 1792, the National Convention was convened, marking the first government of the French First Republic. It abolished the monarchy on September 21, 1792.

6. **Internal Conflicts and Repression**: The period was marked by internal strife, including the September Massacres, where hundreds of suspected counter-revolutionaries were killed.
