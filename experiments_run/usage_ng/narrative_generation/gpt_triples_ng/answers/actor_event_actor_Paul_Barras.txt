During the French Revolution, Paul Barras played a significant role in several key events. He was involved in the Fall of Maximilien Robespierre on 9 Thermidor Year II (27 July 1794), where Robespierre and his allies were arrested and executed, marking the end of the Reign of Terror. This event took place in Paris, specifically at the Hôtel de Ville and led to Robespierre's execution at the Place de la Révolution. Barras's participation in this coup was crucial in ending Robespierre's radical phase of the Revolution.

Barras also played a role in the War of the First Coalition, which was a series of wars between 1792 and 1797 involving several European powers against the French Republic. This conflict saw France defending and then expanding its borders against a coalition of European monarchies. Barras's military and political involvement during this period further solidified his position within the revolutionary government.

Additionally, Barras was a key figure in the battle of 13 Vendémiaire (5 October 1795), where revolutionary troops, under his command, quashed a Royalist uprising in Paris. This victory was instrumental in the establishment of the Directory, a new form of government, and marked a significant advancement in the career of Napoleon Bonaparte, who was under Barras's command during the battle.

Lastly, Barras was involved in the Quasi-War (1798-1800), an undeclared naval conflict between the United States and France. Although this conflict primarily took place after the main period of the French Revolution, it underscores Barras's continued influence in French political and military affairs during the revolutionary era and its aftermath.

In summary, Paul Barras was a central figure during the French Revolution, contributing to the downfall of Robespierre, fighting in the War of the First Coalition, suppressing the Royalist insurrection of 13 Vendémiaire, and playing a role in the Quasi-War with the United States. His actions during these events significantly impacted the course of the Revolution and the establishment of the French Directory.
