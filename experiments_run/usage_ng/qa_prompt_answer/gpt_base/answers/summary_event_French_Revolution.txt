The French Revolution, spanning from 1789 to 1799, was a pivotal period of radical social and political upheaval in France that fundamentally changed the course of French history. The revolution began due to a combination of economic hardship, social inequality, and the influence of Enlightenment ideas. The common people, particularly the Third Estate, grew increasingly discontented with the absolute monarchy and the privileges enjoyed by the nobility and clergy.

Key events include the storming of the Bastille on July 14, 1789, which became a symbol of the revolution; the adoption of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, establishing principles of liberty, equality, and fraternity; and the Reign of Terror (1793-1794), a period marked by extreme violence and the execution of King Louis XVI.

The revolution led to the rise of Napoleon Bonaparte, who eventually declared himself Emperor of France, ending the revolution. The French Revolution profoundly impacted not only France but also the rest of Europe, spreading revolutionary ideals and leading to a series of global conflicts. It laid the groundwork for modern democratic institutions and ideologies.
