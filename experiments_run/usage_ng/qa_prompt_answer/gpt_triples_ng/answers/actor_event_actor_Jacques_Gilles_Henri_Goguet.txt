During the French Revolution, Jacques Gilles Henri Goguet played significant roles in two notable military engagements. Firstly, he was involved in the Battle of Peyrestortes on September 17, 1793, where he, alongside Eustache Charles d'Aoust, temporarily commanded forces of the First French Republic. They successfully defeated two divisions of the Army of Catalonia, marking a setback for the Spanish invasion of Roussillon. This victory was crucial in preventing the Spanish forces from capturing Perpignan and represented the high point of their invasion attempt in the region.

Later, Goguet took part in the Battle of Le Cateau on March 29, 1794, during the 1794 Flanders Campaign, which was part of the War of the First Coalition. In this battle, Goguet, along with Antoine Balland and Jacques Fromentin, led three Republican French divisions in an attack against a Habsburg Austrian force commanded by Paul Kray. Unfortunately, this engagement did not go in favor of the French, as the Austrians managed to drive off the French forces, inflicting significantly higher casualties on the French side.

These engagements highlight Jacques Gilles Henri Goguet's active military leadership during the tumultuous times of the French Revolution, showcasing both his victories and challenges faced on the battlefield.
