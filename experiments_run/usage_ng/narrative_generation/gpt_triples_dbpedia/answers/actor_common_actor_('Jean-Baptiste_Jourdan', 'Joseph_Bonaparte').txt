Jean-Baptiste Jourdan and Joseph Bonaparte were both involved in the Napoleonic Wars, a series of major conflicts that stemmed from the unresolved disputes associated with the French Revolution. Joseph Bonaparte, Napoleon's brother, played a significant role when Napoleon declared him King of Spain in 1808 as Jos√© I, following the French invasion of Portugal and the subsequent occupation of Lisbon in November 1807. This act led to the Spanish and Portuguese revolting with British support, eventually expelling the French from Iberia in 1814 after six years of fighting. Joseph Bonaparte is listed among the commanders in the Napoleonic Wars, indicating his active military and political involvement during this period.

Jean-Baptiste Jourdan, a prominent military commander during the French Revolutionary Wars, continued to serve during the Napoleonic Wars. His experience and leadership would have been integral to the French military efforts throughout these conflicts. Although the context triples do not explicitly mention Jourdan's specific actions during the Napoleonic Wars, his established military career and significance in the French Revolutionary Wars suggest his involvement in the military campaigns of this era.

Both figures were part of the broader Napoleonic Wars, which saw a fluctuating array of European powers formed into various coalitions fighting against the French Empire and its allies, led by Napoleon I. The wars led to a period of French domination over most of continental Europe and had profound consequences on global history, including the spread of nationalism and liberalism, the rise of Britain as the world's foremost naval and economic power, and the fundamental reorganization of German and Italian territories into larger states.
