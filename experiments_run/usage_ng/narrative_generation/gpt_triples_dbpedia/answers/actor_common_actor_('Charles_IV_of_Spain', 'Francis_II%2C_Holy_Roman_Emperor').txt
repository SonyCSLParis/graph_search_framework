Charles IV of Spain and Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor, were both involved in the French Revolutionary Wars, specifically in the War of the First Coalition and the War of the Second Coalition against revolutionary France.

During the War of the First Coalition (1792–1797), various European powers, including Spain under Charles IV and the Holy Roman Empire under Francis II, fought against the constitutional Kingdom of France and then the French Republic that succeeded it. The coalition aimed to contain the French Revolution and restore monarchy in France but failed to defeat France. The war concluded with the Treaty of Campo Formio in 1797, with France gaining territories.

In the War of the Second Coalition (1798–1802), a new alliance formed by Britain, Austria (led by Francis II), Russia, and other monarchies, including Spain under Charles IV, aimed to contain the expansion of the French Republic and restore the monarchy in France. This coalition also failed to achieve its goals, and the war ended with the Treaty of Lunéville in 1801 and the Treaty of Amiens in 1802, confirming French territorial gains and leading to a brief period of peace in Europe.
