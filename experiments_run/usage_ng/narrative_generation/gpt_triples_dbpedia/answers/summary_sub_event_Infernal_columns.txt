The Infernal Columns, led by General Louis Marie Turreau during the French Revolution, were military operations aimed at suppressing Royalist uprisings in the Vendée region, following the failure of the Royalist Virée de Galerne. Initiated after the National Convention passed laws on 1 August and 1 October 1793, these operations sought to exterminate "brigands" south of the Loire River. Twelve army columns were dispatched to annihilate the local anti-Republican population, with Turreau's strategy focusing on total destruction to facilitate the extermination of rebels. Between January and April 1794, it's estimated that 16,000 to 40,000 inhabitants were killed. The actions and implications of the Infernal Columns have sparked intense debate, with historian Reynald Secher labeling it a "Franco-French genocide," a characterization contested by others like Claude Langlois, who views such claims as exaggerated. This controversy remains highly politicized. The term "infernal column" has also been applied to similar tactics used in the Voulet-Chanoine Mission.
