The Storming of the Bastille occurred on July 14, 1789, marking a pivotal event in the French Revolution. The Bastille, a medieval fortress, prison, and symbol of royal authority in central Paris, was attacked by a revolutionary crowd. The insurgents sought to obtain the large quantities of gunpowder stored inside the fortress and to challenge the king's authority. After several hours of combat, the revolutionaries captured the Bastille, releasing a handful of prisoners and seizing the arms and ammunition stored there. The fall of the Bastille became a symbol of the end of the ancien r√©gime and is celebrated annually in France as Bastille Day, a national holiday. This event signaled the beginning of the French Revolution, leading to the downfall of the monarchy, the rise of the French Republic, and significant social and political change in France.
