The Flanders campaign, part of the War of the First Coalition during the French Revolution, was a significant military endeavor that saw the French First Republic fighting against a coalition that included Austria, Hanover, Hesse-Darmstadt, Hesse-Kassel, and the Armée des émigrés. The campaign took place across Belgium, Hauts-de-France, the Netherlands, and the Rhineland, involving numerous battles and sieges such as the Battle of Jemappes, the Siege of Valenciennes, and the Battle of Tourcoing.

The French forces, commanded by notable generals like Charles François Dumouriez, Jean-Baptiste Jourdan, and Jean-Charles Pichegru, achieved a decisive victory. This success led to the annexation of the Austrian Netherlands and Liège by France. Furthermore, the campaign facilitated the establishment of the Batavian Republic as a French satellite state, marking a significant territorial and political reconfiguration in the region.

The Peace of Basel in 1795 saw Prussia and Hesse-Kassel recognizing the French victory and territorial gains. However, Austria did not acknowledge the loss of the Southern Netherlands until the Treaty of Leoben in 1797, later solidified by the Treaty of Campo Formio. The Dutch stadtholder, William V, Prince of Orange, initially refused to recognize the Batavian Republic and sought British support, but eventually, the Oranienstein Letters in 1801 led to his recognition of the Batavian Republic.

The Flanders campaign was a pivotal moment in the French Revolutionary Wars, demonstrating the strength of the French military and significantly altering the political landscape of Europe.
