The Infernal Columns (Colonnes Infernales) were a brutal military strategy employed during the War in the Vendée, a counter-revolutionary uprising in the Vendée region of France during the French Revolution. In early 1794, the French Revolutionary government ordered General Louis Marie Turreau to suppress the Vendéen insurrection with extreme measures. Turreau deployed twelve columns, known as the Infernal Columns, with the aim of systematically destroying the Vendéen rebel strongholds, but their actions quickly escalated into widespread atrocities.

The Infernal Columns were responsible for mass killings, burnings of villages and towns, and the destruction of crops and livestock, aiming to eliminate support for the Vendéen rebels. Their operations led to the deaths of tens of thousands of civilians, including women and children, contributing to what some historians describe as a genocide. The brutal tactics of the Infernal Columns exacerbated the humanitarian crisis in the Vendée and remain a deeply controversial chapter in French Revolutionary history.
