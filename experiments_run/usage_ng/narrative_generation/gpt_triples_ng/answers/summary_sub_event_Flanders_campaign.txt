The Flanders Campaign, part of the French Revolutionary Wars, spanned from 6 November 1792 to 7 June 1795. It was a series of military operations in the Low Countries, involving key figures such as Jean-Charles Pichegru, Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany, and generals like Jean-Baptiste Jourdan. The campaign saw the French Revolutionary armies facing off against Coalition forces, including Britain, Hanover, the Dutch Republic, and the Habsburg Monarchy, across various regions such as the Netherlands, Belgium, and the Rhineland.

Significant battles during this campaign included the Battle of Fleurus on 26 June 1794, where General Jourdan's forces defeated the Coalition army led by Prince Josias of Coburg, marking a pivotal victory for the French. Other notable engagements were the Battle of Mouscron, the Siege of Nijmegen, and the Battle of Tournay, among others. The Battle of Beaumont and the Battle of Erquelinnes were also part of the campaign's efforts to control strategic locations.

The campaign concluded with the French pushing into Amsterdam and establishing the Batavian Republic, annexing the Austrian Netherlands and the Prince-Bishopric of Li√®ge. The Peace of Basel in 1795 saw Prussia and Hesse-Kassel recognizing French territorial gains, although Austria did not acknowledge the loss of the Southern Netherlands until the Treaty of Leoben and later the Treaty of Campo Formio. The campaign significantly altered the political landscape of the Low Countries, setting the stage for further conflicts in the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars.
