Between January 1, 1789, and January 1, 1790, during the French Revolution, the main events included:

1. **Estates-General Convening (May 5, 1789):** The Estates-General was convened to address France's financial crisis, marking the first such assembly since 1614. It brought together representatives from the three estates: the clergy, the nobility, and the commoners.

2. **Third Estate's Transformation into the National Assembly (June 17, 1789):** Frustrated by the voting process, which favored the first two estates, the Third Estate declared itself the National Assembly, asserting its authority to represent the people's will.

3. **Tennis Court Oath (June 20, 1789):** After being locked out of their meeting place, members of the National Assembly gathered in a nearby tennis court, pledging not to disband until a new constitution was established for France.

4. **Storming of the Bastille (July 14, 1789):** A pivotal event where Parisians stormed the Bastille prison, a symbol of royal tyranny, seeking arms and ammunition. This event is often considered the start of the revolutionary period.

5. **The Great Fear (July-August 1789):** A period of panic and rioting by peasants and others amid rumors of an "aristocratic conspiracy" by the king and the privileged to overthrow the Third Estate. This led to widespread violence and the burning of manor houses.

6. **Abolition of Feudal Privileges (August 4-11, 1789):** The National Assembly abolished feudalism, ending serfdom, and the rights and privileges of the nobility and clergy, marking a significant step towards equality.

7. **Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen (August 26, 1789):** The Assembly adopted this foundational document of the French Revolution, affirming individual and collective rights at the time of the Old Regime's collapse.

These events marked the escalation of the revolution from a demand for financial reform to a radical reordering of French society and governance.
