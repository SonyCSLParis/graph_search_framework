The Action of 19 December 1796 was a minor naval engagement during the French Revolutionary Wars, taking place off the coast of Murcia, Spain. This conflict was a direct consequence of the shifting alliances and the broader geopolitical landscape of the time. Initially, Spain had been an ally of Britain, but due to the pressures of the French First Republic, Spain signed a peace treaty with France in August 1795 and was compelled to declare war on Britain following the Treaty of San Ildefonso on 5 October 1796.

As a result of Spain's declaration of war, the British Mediterranean Fleet, under Vice-Admiral Sir John Jervis, found itself outnumbered and isolated, prompting a withdrawal to Lisbon. Jervis then initiated a blockade of the Spanish naval base at CÃ¡diz. By December 1796, the British aimed to evacuate their garrison from the island of Elba, which had been seized earlier from the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. Commodore Horatio Nelson was tasked with this evacuation, commanding the frigates HMS Minerve and HMS Blanche.

During Nelson's mission, his squadron encountered two Spanish Navy frigates off Murcia, led by Commodore Don. In the ensuing engagement, one Spanish frigate was captured, and another was damaged. However, Spanish reinforcements, including the formidable 112-gun ship of the line Principe de Asturias, soon arrived, forcing Nelson to abandon the captured Spanish ship and retreat.

Despite this setback, Nelson successfully evacuated the British garrison from Elba and reconnoitered French and Spanish naval bases on his return to Gibraltar. He rejoined Jervis' fleet in time for the Battle of Cape St. Vincent, where he played a crucial role in the decisive defeat of the main Spanish fleet. This action on 19 December 1796 highlighted the strategic challenges faced by the British in the Mediterranean and underscored the volatile nature of alliances during the French Revolutionary Wars.
