Between January 1, 1789, and January 1, 1790, during the French Revolution, the most significant event was the Storming of the Bastille on July 14, 1789. This event was a pivotal moment in the French Revolution, marking the fall of the medieval armory, fortress, and political prison known as the Bastille in Paris, France. The Bastille was a symbol of the monarchy's abuse of power, and its capture by civilian insurgents and French Guards mutineers represented a victory for the revolutionaries. The combatants on the side of the revolution included between 688 to 1,000 armed civilian insurgents, 61 French Guards, and at least five artillery pieces, facing off against 114 soldiers of the royal government, including veterans and Swiss soldiers, along with 30 artillery pieces. The confrontation resulted in the Bastille being captured, with 98 people killed and 73 wounded. This event is celebrated in France as the national holiday, commonly referred to as Bastille Day in English.
