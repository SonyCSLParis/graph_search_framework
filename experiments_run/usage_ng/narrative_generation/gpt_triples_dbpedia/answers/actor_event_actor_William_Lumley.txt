During the Irish Rebellion of 1798, William Lumley served as a commander for the British troops at the Battle of Antrim, which took place on 7 June 1798, in County Antrim, Ireland. The battle was part of the wider conflict of the Irish Rebellion of 1798, which saw Irish insurgents, led by Henry Joy McCracken and supported by groups such as the United Irishmen, rising against British rule. The British forces, initially numbering around 200 but later reinforced by an additional 500 troops, successfully repelled the rebel attack on Antrim town, despite the insurgents' superior numbers of approximately 4,000. The victory for the British Army came at a cost, with around 300 casualties reported, and it contributed to the suppression of the rebellion in that area.
