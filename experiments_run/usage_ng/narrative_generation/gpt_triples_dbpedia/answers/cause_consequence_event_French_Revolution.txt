The French Revolution, a period of radical political and societal change in France, began in 1789 with the convocation of the Estates-General and ended in November 1799 with the formation of the French Consulate. The Revolution's causes were multifaceted, including social distress, political instability, and economic depression. The Estates-General, convened in May 1789 due to widespread social distress, was transformed into the National Assembly in June, marking the beginning of significant reforms. These reforms included the abolition of feudalism, state control of the Catholic Church, and the extension of voting rights.

The Revolution intensified with the struggle for political control, exacerbated by economic challenges and social unrest. The situation escalated with the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars in April 1792, as external powers like Austria, Britain, and Prussia perceived the Revolution as a threat. The disillusionment with King Louis XVI led to the establishment of the First French Republic on 22 September 1792 and his subsequent execution in January 1793.

A pivotal moment was the Reign of Terror, initiated by the Committee of Public Safety under Maximilien Robespierre, aimed at eradicating "counter-revolutionaries." This period saw over 16,600 executions across Paris and the provinces. The Republic also faced internal challenges, including Royalist and Jacobin revolts.

The French Directory assumed power in November 1795, attempting to stabilize the situation amidst ongoing military engagements and internal divisions. However, the Directory's inability to address economic stagnation and internal discord led to its replacement by the Consulate in November 1799, marking the end of the Revolutionary period.

Throughout the Revolution, significant battles and insurrections, such as the Storming of the Bastille, the Insurrection of 10 August 1792, and the Fall of Maximilien Robespierre, played crucial roles in shaping the course of events. Influential figures like Jean-Jacques Rousseau also inspired the revolutionary ideals. The French Revolution fundamentally altered the political and social landscape of France, laying the groundwork for modern liberal democracy and influencing subsequent global movements for change.
