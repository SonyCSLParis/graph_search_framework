During the French Revolution, the French First Republic and the Dutch Republic were both involved in the following events:

1. **Battle of Erquelinnes (1794)**: This battle was part of the Flanders Campaign during the War of the First Coalition. It saw a Republican French army trying to defend a bridgehead on the north bank of the Sambre River against a combined Habsburg Austrian and Dutch army.

2. **Battle of Lambusart (1794)**: This engagement saw a Republican French army led by Jean Baptiste Jourdan attempting to cross the Sambre River against a combined Dutch and Habsburg Austrian army under William, Hereditary Prince of Orange.

3. **Battle of Fleurus (1794)**: An engagement between the army of the First French Republic and the Coalition Army (Britain, Hanover, Dutch Republic, and Habsburg Monarchy), which was a significant battle of the Flanders Campaign.

4. **Action of 22 August 1795**: A minor naval engagement during the French Revolutionary Wars between a squadron of British Royal Navy frigates and two frigates and a cutter from the Batavian Navy, following the conquest of the Dutch Republic by the French Republic in January 1795.

5. **Siege of Nijmegen (1794)**: The last major military confrontation between the forces of the Revolutionary French First Republic and the reactionary First Coalition of European monarchs, including the Dutch Republic, before its fall in January 1795.

6. **Battle of Gosselies (1794)**: A battle where a Republican French army tried to cross the Sambre River against a joint Dutch and Habsburg Austrian army under William, Hereditary Prince of Orange.

7. **Battle of Aldenhoven (1794)**: A battle where a Republican French army commanded by Jean Baptiste Jourdan attacked a Habsburg army, which included Dutch forces, defending the line of the Roer River.

These events highlight the involvement of both the French First Republic and the Dutch Republic (later as the Batavian Republic following its conquest by France) in various military engagements during the French Revolutionary Wars.
