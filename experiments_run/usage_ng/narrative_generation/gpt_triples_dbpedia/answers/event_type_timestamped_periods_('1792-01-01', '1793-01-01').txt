Between January 1, 1792, and January 1, 1793, during the French Revolution, two main types of events occurred:

1. **Demonstration of 20 June 1792**: This event was a peaceful attempt by the people of Paris to persuade King Louis XVI to abandon his policy and adopt a more empathetic approach to governing. The demonstrators aimed to convince the government to enforce the Legislative Assembly's rulings, defend France against foreign invasion, and preserve the spirit of the French Constitution of 1791. They hoped the king would withdraw his veto and recall the Girondin ministers. This demonstration was part of the broader context of the French Revolution and took place in Paris, France. It represented the last phase of the unsuccessful attempt to establish a constitutional monarchy in France.

2. **Insurrection of 10 August 1792**: This was a defining event of the French Revolution, marked by armed revolutionaries storming the Tuileries Palace in Paris. The conflict led to the abolition of the monarchy and the establishment of a republic. Tensions between King Louis XVI and the revolutionary Legislative Assembly had been escalating, further intensified by the Brunswick Manifesto, which threatened vengeance on Paris should harm be done to the French Monarchy. The National Guard of the Paris Commune and fédérés from Marseille and Brittany participated in the attack, resulting in hundreds of casualties. This insurrection, commonly referred to as "the 10 August," ended with a Republican victory and was a significant step towards the establishment of a Republic in France.

These events highlight the escalating conflict between the monarchy and revolutionaries, leading to the eventual fall of the monarchy and the rise of the Republic.
