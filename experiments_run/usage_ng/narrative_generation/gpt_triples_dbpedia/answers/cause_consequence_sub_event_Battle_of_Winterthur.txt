At the end of the Battle of Winterthur on 27 May 1799, the Austrian forces, commanded by Friedrich Freiherr von Hotze, achieved victory over the French forces led by Michel Ney. This battle was a significant engagement during the War of the Second Coalition, part of the French Revolutionary Wars. The main causal happenings that led to the unfolding of the Battle of Winterthur include:

1. **Strategic Importance of Winterthur**: Winterthur's location was crucial as it controlled access to most of Switzerland and points crossing the Rhine into southern Germany. This made it a key objective for both the Austrian and French forces.

2. **Austrian Advances**: By mid-May 1799, Austrian forces under Hotze and Count Heinrich von Bellegarde had pushed the French out of parts of Switzerland, including the Grisons, after defeating Jean-Baptiste Jourdan's Army of the Danube at the battles of Ostrach and Stockach.

3. **Archduke Charles' Plan**: The main Austrian army, under Archduke Charles, crossed the Rhine at Schaffhausen and aimed to unite with the armies of Hotze and Friedrich Joseph, Count of Nauendorf, on the plains surrounding Zürich.

4. **French Response**: To prevent the merger of Austrian forces, André Masséna, commanding both the French Army of Helvetia and the Army of the Danube, dispatched Michel Ney with a small mixed force to confront Hotze's troops at Winterthur.

5. **The Battle**: Despite a fierce contest and high casualties on both sides, the Austrians managed to push the French out of the Winterthur highlands. This success allowed the consolidation of three Austrian forces north of Zürich, setting the stage for a French defeat a few days later when Archduke Charles attacked French positions at Zürich, forcing them to withdraw beyond the Limmat.

The Battle of Winterthur, therefore, was a pivotal moment that led to the Austrian victory, significantly influenced by the strategic importance of Winterthur, the successful Austrian advances in Switzerland, and the decisive Austrian consolidation north of Zürich following their victory at Winterthur.
