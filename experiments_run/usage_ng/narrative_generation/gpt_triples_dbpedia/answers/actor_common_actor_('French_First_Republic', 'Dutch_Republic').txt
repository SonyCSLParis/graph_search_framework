It appears there was an oversight, as no context triples were provided in your question. However, I can still provide information on the events during the French Revolution in which both the French First Republic and the Dutch Republic were involved.

One of the key events involving both the French First Republic and the Dutch Republic during the French Revolution was the War of the First Coalition. This conflict, part of the broader Revolutionary Wars, saw various European monarchies, including the Dutch Republic (which was then under a stadtholder, a form of governance that included monarchical elements), opposing revolutionary France.

- **Invasion of the Dutch Republic (1795):** French revolutionary forces invaded the Dutch Republic in 1795, leading to the establishment of the Batavian Republic, a French client state. This effectively ended the old Dutch Republic, bringing it into the French sphere of influence and aligning it with the aims of the French Revolution.

These events marked significant interactions between the French First Republic and the Dutch Republic during the tumultuous period of the French Revolution.
